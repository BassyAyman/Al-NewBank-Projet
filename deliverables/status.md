# Weekly status

## Week 39 `sunday 2023-10-01`

### What was done
* Study on the bank transaction model in real life
* Understanding of the different components of a bank, and how it works in real life 
* Architecture diagram has been made, based on how we could organise the thing to make a transaction
* Flow Diagram has also been made to present the basic actual MVP flow
* Study on how our MVP could respond to our scaling problematic

### What is planned
* Decide if we want to make it an application based on different service, or a monolithic 3 tier architecture app
* Decide on the techno that will be used for this project based on how we want to implement it
* Decide on how we will expose our app to other external system
* Try to implement a first flow going throug every part that make a transaction, to get started with the POC.

### Different from last week
* new Architecture 
### Issues
* none
### Risk
* we are reducing the scope to the transaction systeme first, before all other functionality.
### RYG flag
* As there are many thing that have to be decided regarding the project, and that there's no implementation, we would say in between green and yellow.
