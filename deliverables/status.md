# Weekly Status (Week 40) :

## What was done:

* a diagram of all service 
* a component diagram for the 2 spring service
* Personas
* User Stories
* Study on the V7 subject : Scalability

## What is planned

* For Tuesday, make a sequence diagram for each US
* Start a first implementation if the model is validated

## What's the difference from last week
* The architecture has been modified again, to better meet requirements
* Component diagrams for certain services have been added
* New Persona and User Story

## Issues : 

* None

## Risk : 

* We are reducing the scope to the transaction system first, before all other functionality.
* Uncertainty about certain hypotheses formulated to meet the subject's needs V7

## RYG flag : 

* Yellow : indeed we have a lot of new things for this time, but regarding the architecture, we made quite a lot of hypotheses 
regarding the scalability and the neobank accessible in other country. So we may be taking the wrong path on this one which 
Implies refactor.
